            RELAP5 has extensive application in analysis in nuclear and non-nuclear thermal-hydraulics systems which was
            developed by INEL for USNRC. This code can be used for estimation of accident’s consequences in nuclear
            power plants, providing operator’s guidelines for accident mitigation, evaluation of design, and also
            licensing of
            nuclear plants. Additionally, SCDAP is a severe accident code that makes the analysis of core melting
            process and leakage of FPs possible. In this workshop coupled RELAP5/SCDAP will be used to
            investigate the effect of the accident on the several reactors based on its latest designs. This code is
            capable of modeling thermal-hydraulics behavior of the systems,
            heat-up and structural damage, ballooning, oxidation of the clad, fuel and control rod meltdown, debris
            formation, structural damage to lower plenum and fission product leakage.
